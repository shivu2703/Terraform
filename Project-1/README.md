This Terraform configuration creates an EC2 instance with an IAM role that grants read-only access to an S3 bucket. It also sets up a security group for SSH and HTTP access, an SSH key pair for authentication, and uploads a test file to S3. The EC2 instance can securely retrieve objects from the S3 bucket without needing explicit credentials.
